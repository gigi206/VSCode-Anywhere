# VSCode-Anywhere

This is the V2 version, please read the [documentation](https://gigi206.gitbook.io/vscode-anywhere/#vscode-anywhere-installation) for more information and how to install it.

## What is VSCode-Anywhere ?

VSCode-Anywhere is based on [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com), a cross-platform software for development with:

- [IntelliSense](https://code.visualstudio.com/#meet-intellisense) to automatically complete your code

- [Debugging](https://code.visualstudio.com/#powerful-debugging) to debug your code with break points, call stacks, and an interactive console
- [Git](https://code.visualstudio.com/#built-in-git) to manage your code with a VCS
- [Extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/#hundreds-of-extensions) to add new languages, themes, debuggers, and to connect to additional services

**_VSCode-Anywhere_** is a portable software. This means that you can use this tool anywhere (on an USB key for example) without privileges (you don't need **Administrator** account on Windows or **root** on Linux).

VSCode-Anywhere is preconfigured with features, you can enable, modify or add your own features in the configuration file.

With traditionnal VSCode, for example if you want to develop with the _Python_ language, you must have Python installed with some Python modules like **flake8** and configure the settings. With VSCode-Anywhere you need to enable the Python section in the configuration file and start the installation process.

Also, VSCode-Anywhere installs for you the documentation of your language. Still with the Python example, the Python2 and Python3 documentation will be downloaded and you will have access to this documentation directly through your code.

Many modules are available in this tool like git, platformio, python, perl, ruby, C, C++, PHP, Java, JavaScript...
