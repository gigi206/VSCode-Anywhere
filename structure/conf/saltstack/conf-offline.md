# conf-offline

The `VSCode-Anywhere/conf/saltstack/conf-offline` directory does not exist by default.

This directory is only created when you run the [link script](https://vscode-anywhere.readthedocs.io/en/dev/structure/tools/link.html#tool-link).

This directory has the same structure of the [conf directory](https://vscode-anywhere.readthedocs.io/en/dev/structure/conf/saltstack/conf/index.html#conf-saltstack-conf).

{% hint style="success" %}
You can safely remove this directory.
{% endhint %}
