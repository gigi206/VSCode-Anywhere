# update

This script allows to update all `enabled` [VSCode-Anywhere modules](https://vscode-anywhere.readthedocs.io/en/dev/modules/index.html#modules).

The script `VSCode-Anywhere/tools/update.ps1` for Windows or `VSCode-Anywhere/tools/update.sh` for Linux / MacOS try to update all components inside a [VSCode-Anywhere module](../../modules/install.md) set to `enabled`.

To apply changes:

* on Windows, right clic on the `install.ps1` file and clic on `Run with PowerShell`
* on Linux / Mac run the script with your favorite terminal
