description: Compute new link after moved your installation directory
---

# link

The script `VSCode-Anywhere/tools/link.ps1` for Windows or `VSCode-Anywhere/tools/link.sh` for Linux / MacOS allows you to recreate all links if you renamed or moved your installation directory.

To apply changes:

* on Windows, right-click on the `install.ps1` file and click on `Run with PowerShell`
* on Linux / Mac run the script with your favorite terminal

  Rename or move the installation directory is not recommended without having the profile set to [windows\_portable](../../install/advanced/windows-installation.md#profiles), mac\_admin, or [linux\_user](../../install/advanced/linux-installation.md#profiles).
