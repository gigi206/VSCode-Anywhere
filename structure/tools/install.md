# install

The script `VSCode-Anywhere/tools/install.ps1` for Windows or `VSCode-Anywhere/tools/install.sh` for Linux / MacOS applies the [settings](../../modules/settings/) for each [VSCode-Anywhere modules](../../modules/install.md) that you set to `enabled` in the `VSCode-Anywhere/conf/saltstack/pillar/vscode-anywhere.sls` configuration file.

To apply changes:

* on Windows, right clic on the `install.ps1` file and clic on `Run with PowerShell`
* on Linux / Mac run the script with your favorite terminal
