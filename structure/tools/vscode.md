description: Run VSCode / VScodium

# vscode

The script `VSCode-Anywhere/tools/vscode.ps1` for Windows or `VSCode-Anywhere/tools/vscode.sh` for Linux / MacOS is called by the VSCode-Anywhere link file present in the installation `VSCode-Anywhere`directory.

{% hint style="info" %}
It is better to launch the link inside the installation directory instead to run this file.

This script sources the [env](env.md) file before running VSCode / VSCodium.
{% endhint %}
