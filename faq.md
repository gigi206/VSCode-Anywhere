# FAQ

## Installation failed

VSCode-Anywhere actually does not support spaces in the install directory path.

## On Linux .desktop files do not appear correctly

This is a limitation due to your file manager, please read [the available solutions](install/advanced/linux-installation.md#linux-shortcuts-icons).

## On Linux, my $HOME is not my real HOME

Please read [the possible workarounds](install/advanced/linux-installation.md#home).

## Some Saltstack states failing

Simply run again the install or update script. VSCode-Anywhere will compute what is missing on your system.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If the problem persists, you can open an issue.
{% endhint %}

## VSCode-Anywhere is very slow when installing, locks up the CPU, or shows access denied errors

Itâ€™s likely that your antivirus or anti-malware program is doing a realtime scan as files are being extracted.

Please see Antivirus and Anti-Malware problems for more information and possible workarounds.

{% hint style="info" %}
It is advised to put the installation directory in the white list of your antivirus or anti-malware program.
{% endhint %}

## VSCode-Anywhere takes a lot of disk space

You can free up disk space with the following command to delete all unnecessary things:

```text
$ cd <install_dir>/tools
$ ./vscode-anywhere.sh vscode_anywhere.cleanup
local:
----------
brew:
    - 1578 store paths deleted, 2633.53 MiB freed
nix:
    - ...
    - ...
    - ...
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Replace `vscode-anywhere.sh` by `vscode-anywhere.ps1` on Windows.
{% endhint %}

## Language is only detected at the 2nd run

VSCode-Anywhere detects the OS locale and sets it automatically inside VSCode.

There is a bug inside VSCode and the language is only detected in the **2nd** run.

VSCode-Anywhere auto-detects and configure for you the following languages: `en`, `fr`, `es`, `de`, `it`, `ja`, `ru`, `hu`, `ko`, `bg`, `tr`, `pt_br`, `zh_cn` and `zh_tw`.

## I have the following message: _found a tab character that violates indentation_

In all files in the conf directory of your root installation, you must use spaces and not tabs.

The best way is to use VSCode-Anywhere to edit your config files because by default it replaces tabs with spaces.

If you get the following messages, please replace all of your tabs by spaces in your configuration files:
